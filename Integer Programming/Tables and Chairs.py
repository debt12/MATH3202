"""
Notes and Assumptions:

A food court would like to place tables and chairs so that they can maximise the number of chairs in the area, while ensuring that
- There is at most one chair or table per square, but nothing on the rubbish
- No tables connect, even diagonally
- a chair must have a table beside it

Square is: 18 x 7 with rubbbish located over 9 & 10 x 1 (count started at 1)
